**LiveStats** is a small program running a Node JS backend and Python (or any MQTT-compatible language) front-end that allows for devices on a network to be monitored from a central point.\
**Please note** that this is nowhere near finished as of 29/05/18\
To-Do:
 - Compilation of Python to EXE files for Windows
 - Other types of system data (Such as storage left on primary drive, etc.)
 - Two-way transfer ie. execution of remote commands (although this could be risky if handled incorrectly)
